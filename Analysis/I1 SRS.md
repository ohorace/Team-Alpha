Version 1.1  

For our project we will be making an ATM.  
We expect this project to allow a user to sign into an account via a password.  
From there, they should be able to deposit and withdraw money.   
They should also be able to see the current account balance as well as recent transacations.  
The account should not allow any withdrawals to be made if the account has been overdrawn.  
The user should be able to have the option to transfer money between accounts, perhaps from savings to checkings or vice versa.
